# Movie App

This is a movie app based on the TMDB API. It consists of two pages, Home and Discover. On the homepage the user can see movies that are "Top rated" and "Now playing". There is also a search function on the home page. Each movie can be opened on click, which makes it possible to see more information and the trailer of the movie. On the discover page, several genres can be selected to filter movies.
